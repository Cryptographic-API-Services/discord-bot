We have a discord server for support located at the link above. This chatbot uses Ollama with Llama3 and Langchain to query our documentation hosted on GitHub to give the user a response.

## How to Query Bot Commands Supported
`Hey bot:` is a general query to prompt Llama3 with a question.

`Documentation:` is a query against a vector store of our documentation.
